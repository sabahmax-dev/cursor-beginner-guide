## Who is this guide for?

This material is for developers who are starting with Cursor and want to go beyond the basics. If you already know how to code but have never used an AI agent to write code—or you have, but felt you were not getting the most out of it—this guide is for you.

### Part 1 — Core guide

By the end of Part 1, you will understand:

- How to **think** when working with AI (the right mental model)
- How to use Cursor’s **three modes** (Ask, Agent, Plan)
- How to create **rules** so the agent follows your project’s standards
- How to use **skills** to automate workflows
- How to apply all of this in practice with real exercises

### Part 2 — Agent orchestration

New material that extends Part 1. You will understand:

- How to combine **skills**, the **main agent**, and **sub-agents** into predictable flows
- When to use each piece and how to avoid wasting context
- How **`/poteto-mode`** (pstack plugin) packages that orchestration so you can reuse it as a method

## Guide structure

### Part 1 — Core (foundations through hands-on guides)

### [01 — Foundations](./01-fundamentos/)

Before using any tool, we need to understand **how to think** when working with AI. This section covers the right mental model, the idea of context, and why “using AI” is different from “working with AI.”

| File                                                        | Content                                                     |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| [01-modelo-mental.md](./01-fundamentos/01-modelo-mental.md) | AI as a junior dev — what it does well and what it does not |
| [02-contexto.md](./01-fundamentos/02-contexto.md)           | What context is, why it matters, and how to manage it       |
| [03-workflow.md](./01-fundamentos/03-workflow.md)           | The Research → Plan → Implement loop                        |

### [02 — Modes](./02-modos/)

Cursor has three interaction modes. Each has a specific purpose. Using the right mode at the right time is the difference between frustration and productivity.

| File                                            | Content                                  |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| [01-ask-mode.md](./02-modos/01-ask-mode.md)     | Read-only mode — research and understand |
| [02-plan-mode.md](./02-modos/02-plan-mode.md)   | Planning mode — design the solution      |
| [03-agent-mode.md](./02-modos/03-agent-mode.md) | Execution mode — implement changes       |

### [03 — Rules](./03-regras/)

Rules are permanent instructions the agent follows automatically. They are like a developer handbook for your project that the AI always consults.

| File                                                         | Content                              |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| [01-o-que-sao-regras.md](./03-regras/01-o-que-sao-regras.md) | Concept, types, and when to use them |
| [02-criando-regras.md](./03-regras/02-criando-regras.md)     | How to create rules step by step     |

### [04 — Skills](./04-skills/)

Skills are reusable workflows the agent runs on demand. Unlike rules (which are “always on”), skills are triggered when you need them.

| File                                                         | Content                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| [01-o-que-sao-skills.md](./04-skills/01-o-que-sao-skills.md) | Concept and difference between rules and skills |
| [02-criando-skills.md](./04-skills/02-criando-skills.md)     | How to create skills step by step               |

### [05 — Hands-on guides](./05-guias-praticos/)

Hands-on exercises to apply what you learned. Each guide has real prompts you can copy, paste, and run.

| File                                                                                       | Content                                        |

| [06-exercicio-workflow-completo.md](./05-guias-praticos/06-exercicio-workflow-completo.md) | From zero to PR — full workflow                |

### Part 2 — Agent orchestration

Skills, the main agent, and sub-agents work together. This part explains **when** to use each and how to design a flow without wasting context. **Read after Skills (04)** and, if you want orchestration in your exercises, **before the hands-on guides (05)**.

| File                                                                                         | Content                                                         |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [01-agent-orchestration-overview.md](./06-orquestracao-de-agentes/01-agent-orchestration-overview.md) | Concepts: skill, agent, sub-agent, and how they fit             |
| [02-orquestrando-na-pratica.md](./06-orquestracao-de-agentes/02-orquestrando-na-pratica.md)             | Step-by-step: design and test an orchestrated flow              |
| [03-pdf-orchestration-example.md](./06-orquestracao-de-agentes/03-pdf-orchestration-example.md)       | Example: large PDF → topics, short & long summary via sub-agents |
| [04-poteto-mode.md](./06-orquestracao-de-agentes/04-poteto-mode.md)                                     | `/poteto-mode` (pstack): playbooks, `/how`, `/why`, when to use |

## How to use this guide

1. **Part 1** — follow **01 → 02 → 03 → 04** in order, then the **hands-on guides (05)** (or mix in exercises however you prefer).
2. **Part 2** — after **04 — Skills**, read **06 — Agent orchestration**; then return to **05** if you have not finished the guides yet, or use Part 2 as reference when repeating exercises.
3. **Do the exercises** — reading about AI does not replace practicing with AI
4. **Try it in your project** — adapt the examples to your context
5. **Come back when you need it** — use it as day-to-day reference

## Prerequisites

- Cursor IDE installed ([cursor.com](https://cursor.com))
- An existing project to practice on (any project works)
- Basic programming knowledge (any language)
- Willingness to experiment and make mistakes (it is part of the process)
